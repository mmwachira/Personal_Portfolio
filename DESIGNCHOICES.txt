DESIGN CHOICES
1. I used external css for most of the css designs to allow for global styling across the website.
2. I integrated JavaScript to have more responsiveness.

CHALLENGES FACED
1. Having responsive menus
2. Mobile friendliness
3. Hosting on a web server

HOW CHALLENGES WERE SOLVED
1. I used JavaScript to tackle responsiveness.
2. I used responsive CSS design techniques as well as media queries.
3. I was able to host on infinityfreeapp.com but on opening the website there were some problems with the layout so in the end I decided to submit the code without hosting on the web server.
